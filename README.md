Develop a Photo Album app.
1) Use a list layout in portrait mode and grid layout in landscape mode.
ListItem layout should have an image on the left side and image Name/Title next to it.

- We are leaving out Layout specification like width, height for list and Grid items. You can use your own
judgement to make the layout presentable. UI will be evaluated based on material design guide lines.
- The application should be production ready code. The application will be evaluated for reliability,
efficiency, resource utilization and
scalability of the code.
- We1ll also evaluate it to gauge your understanding of best practices, design patterns and coding style.
- Use components from latest android versions to showcase your knowledge about Android.

You code was functional. If I were to compare your code with what other candidates have submittedâ€¦. It would have been nice to see code architected using latest from architecture components. Naming scheme for classes was little confusing.
